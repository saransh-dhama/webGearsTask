# About This Task
## Theme and design
I am aware that the UI/design and theme of the application holds no significance for an evaluator still I choose to create one as personal choice.
For styling the application I have used 'styled-components' as the provide a very easy and highly modular way to style a React app.

All the theme variables are store in './src/utils/theme/themeConstants.js' and various components can access these variable through themeprovider.
With this approach all the colors and theme elements can be updated from one place. A single source of truth for theme.

## State management
